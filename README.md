### Production journal：
I plan to continue the design from project 2. Modify and upgrade the issues mentioned in the project proposal. At the beginning of the design, I wanted to upgrade the way the content of the website was presented. Improve the look and feel of users browsing the web by adding interactive carousels. Diversify the page by adding more images.

According to the Scrum method, I do product planning around the characteristics of the Minimum Viable Product. First to fix some issues that existed in Project 2. Project 3 is then developed as a minimum viable product. The development process mainly includes developing the components (Vue files) of each page. Then compile again.After switching to Vue, use the element component to achieve an interactive carousel effect. Also ensure that the website meets the requirements of loading dynamic data through multiple APIs. The product is then tested and reviewed. During testing, it was found that the newly added components and functions were not functioning properly.Use the Error warning to log and try to fix the problem. After fixing the problem, the appropriate description is still added as a prompt for easy viewing. This process is then cycled to end up with a viable product. Since it was a smaller project, the process took about a week. Using this Scrum method reduces the time at each stage from product planning to development and testing.The next step is to start incremental releases. Call it a "Sprint". Keep repeating the sprint until the page is fully functional. Because this is a continuation project. The function of the website has been relatively perfect. So I didn't spend much time. Incrementally I just added the image scheme from the product plan to a few pages. Although there are no major changes to the project, so far the project has met my development expectations.

There are three important roles in the Scrum method. But since this project is done by me alone. So I am responsible for the work of all three. First as a product manager, I need to identify the product's features and come up with the product's highlights. Secondly, as a Scrum Master, that is, the person in charge of the product and the team. I need to use all my resources to help the team complete the project. It is also necessary to organize meetings and carry out security work for the project.Lastly are the team members. They have different divisions of labor. Developers, testers, copywriters, R&D assistants, etc. are all important parts of a team. No matter what the division of labor is, everyone is working towards the same goal. That's trying to get the product done and functioning properly.But in the development process, because the team is only me. I have no way of brainstorming. My energy is also very limited. Some good ideas end up not being realized due to time and technical reasons. Through this, I realized the importance of teamwork and division of labor. If there are opportunities in the future, I would like to use teamwork to complete the development of a website. I believe that through teamwork, we can get a better product.

### Project: Design proposal：
Revised background
Problems in the web page structure/ complex and repetitive category display on the home page / high cost of design, communication and maintenance, it is difficult to improve the user experience in a unified way / difficult for users to establish a cognition of web page modules.
1. The web page floor module is complex
2. Web page module conversion rate is low
3. Design communication and maintenance costs are high

Main problems/framework and presentation
1. The information level is complex: the display of web content is complicated, which affects the user's browsing efficiency.
2. Low standardization of web design: poor uniformity, high design communication and maintenance costs
3. Poor web page interaction experience: The page transitions are stuck, and there is a sense of jumping. The page interaction logic is complex.

Improvement direction
1. Streamline modules
Condense the web page into three sections. Remove redundant category floors. Preserve the efficient "golden floor" at the top of the page. Optimize the browsing path of users on the home page. Optimize the home page display area for user groups to improve the browsing efficiency of the home page.

Design goals
1. Simplify complexity - adjust and optimize the information level between modules. Present clear and concise information to users.
2. Standardization and unification - consider the operation situation and usage scenarios. Unify the page style and design specifications of the web pages. Reduce post-maintenance costs for web pages.
3. Experience optimization - optimize the interactive experience of web pages, and optimize the transition between pages through dynamic effects and other methods. Improve the user's experience.

Summarize
Through improvements, we hope to give users a streamlined and efficient experience. Establish users' awareness of the website, so as to establish the difference of the website.
Further enhance the interactive experience of web pages by adding motion effects. A good operating experience can also improve user perception. "Excellent interactive experience" will also become one of the labels of the website.
In subsequent iterations, in-depth optimization can be carried out for the dimensions of experience.Provide users with a better web browsing experience.
