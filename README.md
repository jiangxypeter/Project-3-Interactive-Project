### Production journalï¼š
I plan to continue the design from project 2. Modify and upgrade the issues mentioned in the project proposal. At the beginning of the design, I wanted to upgrade the way the content of the website was presented. Improve the look and feel of users browsing the web by adding interactive carousels. Diversify the page by adding more images.
# According to the Scrum method, I do product planning around the characteristics of the Minimum Viable Product. First to fix some issues that existed in Project 2. Project 3 is then developed as a minimum viable product. The development process mainly includes developing the components (Vue files) of each page. Then compile again.After switching to Vue, use the element component to achieve an interactive carousel effect. Also ensure that the website meets the requirements of loading dynamic data through multiple APIs. The product is then tested and reviewed. During testing, it was found that the newly added components and functions were not functioning properly.Use the Error warning to log and try to fix the problem. After fixing the problem, the appropriate description is still added as a prompt for easy viewing. This process is then cycled to end up with a viable product. Since it was a smaller project, the process took about a week. Using this Scrum method reduces the time at each stage from product planning to development and testing.The next step is to start incremental releases. Call it a "Sprint". Keep repeating the sprint until the page is fully functional. Because this is a continuation project. The function of the website has been relatively perfect. So I didn't spend much time. Incrementally I just added the image scheme from the product plan to a few pages. Although there are no major changes to the project, so far the project has met my development expectations.
